# MapLeaf-Django-Geo
This web application utilizes the Leaflet library to provide users with interactive maps that seamlessly integrate with PostgreSQL, leveraging the power of the PostGIS extension. The user interface (UI) is designed to enable users to effortlessly create and store various shapes directly on the map. Whether it's markers, polygons, circles, or other geometric entities, users can easily define and customize these shapes to suit their needs. With the Leaflet library and PostGIS integration, this application empowers users to explore and interact with spatial data in a visually engaging and intuitive manner.
